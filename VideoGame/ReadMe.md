Our video game is titled Bob the I.T. Guy and takes place in a High-Tech Science Facility. He is hired to remove a reported virus from the central database. He also knows that the facility holds a powerful weapon called the Propagator. By the time he catches the virus, it is too late and it has released all of the cyborg zombie specimens from their holding capsules. They begin to storm the room and he fights them to protect himself and the Propagator.

The player is able to freely navigate in the given area and must decisively evade and shoot the zombies. The base weapon represents classical mechanics with a the ball projectile following a linear trajectory. Every thirty seconds, the player has the ability to pick up the Propagator which powers up your weapon into a wave blasting cannon. Once fired, it deals massive damage to every enemy in the area and deducts the health of the enemies by using Schrödinger’s equation. The objective of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible, until the player’s health has depleted.
