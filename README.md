# Quantum_Lib
A library to model several mechanical/ quantum models

Includes the following methods and classes:
FFT.java ~ From Princeton CS intro site, to manage Fast Fourier Tranformation
Complex.java ~ From Princeton CS intro site, to aid in management of Complex numbers as Java is unable to handle imaginary concepts
QuantumMethods.java ~ All methods which can be used to create simulations
  1. propogation ~ given the inputs, it can be used to calculate wave propogation
  2. getAngle ~ given an angle of bounce θ, this will give the angle the ball will bounce from reference angle θ
  3. getEnergy ~ given parameters, calculates the amount of energy an object has
  4. calculateVelocity ~ Will calculate the velocity of the object given the inputs
  5. predictChance ~ given an array of previous answers, and the prime answer choice, this method will tell you the % chance of getting the prime value
