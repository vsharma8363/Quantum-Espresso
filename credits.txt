~~~~~~~~~~~Credits File~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following files:
1. FTT.java
2. Complex.java

Are from the Pinceton CS intro website (link here: http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/97data/)
These were necessary to allow the use of both Complex numbers and both Inverse and normal Fast Fourier Tranformations

However the Mechanics.java file and all others were created from scratch
